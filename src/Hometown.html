            <h4 class="attractions-list-item-title">The Forbidden City</h4>

            <p>
                The Forbidden City was for almost five centuries the palatial heart of China. Constructed in 1420,
                it is China's best-preserved imperial palace, and the largest ancient palatial structure in the world.
                It is also a magnificent treasure trove, which holds more than a million rare and valuable works of art.
                The collection includes ceramics, paintings, calligraphy, bronzes, timepieces, jade pieces, ancient
                books, and historical documents. There, you can witness the grand architecture, learn about China’s
                royal culture inside the city walls, and appreciate the precious treasures of the royal court.
            </p>

            <p>
                How to make the most of your time in this huge imperial palace complex? Visiting halls along the
                central axis from The Meridian Gate to the Gate of Devine Might is the most common route. Some of
                the most important buildings are located on this axis, such as the Hall of Supreme Harmony, Hall
                of Central Harmony, Hall of Preserving Harmony, and Palace of Heavenly Purity.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, you might
                want to travel with us for a deeper Forbidden City exploration. Rather than simply taking you round
                to see the buildings, and giving you textbook recitals or routine guide presentations, we attempt to
                bring the emperors’ lives to life for you, through fascinating stories with original iPad pictures and
                videos. You will be taken to see places that you would never find by yourself or on a standard tour.

            <h4 class="attractions-list-item-title">The Summer Palace</h4>

            <div id="photo_2" class="attractions-list-item-img">
                <button @click="pre">left</button>
                <img :alt="photoes_2[index_2].alt"

                <button @click="next">right</button>
            </div>

            <p>
                The Summer Palace is 15 kilometers (9 miles) from downtown Beijing. It was a summer retreat for the
                royal family of the Qing Dynasty (1644–1912). It is also the largest and best-preserved imperial garden
                in China, with famous landscaped views and cultural points of interest. The Summer Palace has greatly
                influenced Chinese horticulture and landscape gardening.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Long Corridor in the Summer Palace gardens is the most notable sight, with every on beam decorated
                with colorful paintings — more than 14,000 in total. You can stroll around it and listen to tales
                described by the paintings.
            </p>


            <h4 class="attractions-list-item-title">The Temple of Heaven</h4>

            <div id="photo_3" class="attractions-list-item-img">

                <button @click="next">right</button>
            </div>

            <p>
                The Temple of Heaven is an imperial worship site where emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties took
                part in annual ceremonies to pray for a good harvest for the next year. The annual sacrificial
                ceremonies at the Temple of Heaven were the emperors' most important religious and political activities.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Circular Mound Altar and The Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests are the must-see highlights, you
                can learn about the culture of heaven worship, architectural geomancy, and the medieval China’s
                sacrificial rites.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you’re travel with kids, a visit to the Echo Wall is strongly recommended. Your kid(s) will be
                surprised by the magic of the echo. If you say something to him/her quietly at one end of the wall,
                they should hear your message even though standing 100–150 meters away.
            </p>

            <p>
                Nowadays, the Temple of Heaven stands in a public park that is full of life. In the morning lots of
                local elderly people meet there to sing, exercise and do tai chi. The park is south of Central Beijing,
                about 15 minutes south of the Forbidden City by car.
            </p>


            <h4 class="attractions-list-item-title">Tian'anmen Square</h4>

            <div class="attractions-list-item-img">

                     src="../resources/img/Tian'anmenSquare.png">
            </div>

            <p>
                Tian'anmen Square is the largest famous city square. In the center of Beijing, it sits to the south
                of the Forbidden City. Tian'anmen Square is very symbolic for Chinese people, as it was the site of
                several key events in Chinese history, such as the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.
            </p>

            <p>
                Nowadays, it is still the most significant square in China, where grand ceremonies and National Day
                anniversary parades are held.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each morning, the flag-raising ceremony is held at sunrise, which is open to the public most of the
                time. On the night before Chinese National Day, many Chinese even sit up near the square for a whole
                night just to watch the flag being raised the next morning. Join us to witness this solemn ceremony
                in Beijing.
